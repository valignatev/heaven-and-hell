;; Author: Valentin Ignatev <valentignatev@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/valignatev/heaven-and-hell
;; Version: 0.0.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4"))
;; Keywords: faces

;;; Commentary:
;; Light themes are easier on the eyes when sun is up.
;; But when it's dark around - you better to use dark theme.
;; This package makes process of switching between light and dark
;; theme as easy as hitting single keystroke.
;; Features:
;; * Define your favorite light and dark themes
;; * Choose which one to run by default
;; * Switch between them with a single keypress
;; * Easily roll back to default Emacs theme in case of messed faces
;;
;; Example configuration:
;; Default is 'light
;; (setq heaven-and-hell-theme-type 'dark)
;;
;; Set preferred light and dark themes (it can be a list of themes as well)
;; Default light is Emacs default theme, default dark is wombat
;; (setq heaven-and-hell-themes
;;       '((light . tsdh-light)
;; 	(dark . (tsdh-dark wombat))))
;;
;; Add init-hook so heaven-and-hell can load your theme
;; (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'heaven-and-hell-init-hook)
;;
;; Set keys to toggle theme and return to default Emacs theme
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-c <f6>") 'heaven-and-hell-load-default-theme)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'heaven-and-hell-toggle-theme)
