Heaven and Hell - emacs package for easy toggling of light/dark color themes.

## TLDR:

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Why?

I constantly switch light and dark theme.
When it's sunny outside, or I work in a very light room - I use the light theme.
Otherwise, I prefer dark one.
So I wrote a bunch of helpers which helped me with this and one day I decided to make a package out of it.
Hope it'll be useful to anybody else. Cheers!

## Features

* Define your favorite light and dark themes
* Choose which one to run by default
* Switch between them with a single keypress
* Easily roll back to default emacs theme in case of messed faces

## Installation

`heaven-and-hell` is available in [Melpa](https://melpa.org/#/heaven-and-hell).

With `use-package` (including example config):
```emacs-lisp
(use-package heaven-and-hell
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq heaven-and-hell-theme-type 'dark) ;; Omit to use light by default
  (setq heaven-and-hell-themes
        '((light . tsdh-light)
          (dark . tsdh-dark))) ;; Themes can be the list: (dark . (tsdh-dark wombat))
  ;; Optionall, load themes without asking for confirmation.
  (setq heaven-and-hell-load-theme-no-confirm t)
  :hook (after-init . heaven-and-hell-init-hook)
  :bind (("C-c <f6>" . heaven-and-hell-load-default-theme)
         ("<f6>" . heaven-and-hell-toggle-theme)))
```

        (dark . tsdh-dark)))
;; Optionall, load themes without asking for confirmation.

;; Add init-hook so heaven-and-hell can load your theme
(add-hook 'after-init-hook 'heaven-and-hell-init-hook)

;; Set keys to toggle theme and return to default emacs theme
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c <f6>") 'heaven-and-hell-load-default-theme)
